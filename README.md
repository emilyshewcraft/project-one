### Project Description:
We plan to look at global trends for salaries in data science related professions over the time period of 2020 to 2023.

## Research Questions/Analysis:
* What are the differences in salaries between job titles under the data science umbrella?
    - The differences we found in salaries between job titles under the data science umbrella. For example, more or less salary at different levels of expertise in their position, with some going as high as the director role and others to the expert level. Not to mention, between certain positions, you'll see a much higher percent increase in salary compared to others. For example, comparing the average salary of a junior data analyst to a intermediate goes from about $65,000 to $100,000 with about a 1.53x increase while a data scientist making the same expertise progression would on average only see about a 1.26x increase going from about $75,000 to $95,000.
* What is the wage gap between experience/expertise levels?
    - Going from a certain experience/expertise level to another comes with a major increase for just about all job positions, although some being much more drastic than others. On average, for a position going from the junior level to the intermediate level in expertise levels, all jobs averaged a wage increase of about 1.36x what they had previously made in the junior level of the position. Judging from the overall lowest to highest level between job levels, the average increase in salary comes out to about 2.12x their starting salary at the junior level.
* Does company size have an impact on salary?
    - Judging from the dataset, the only conclusion based on company size that can be made is smaller companies are tending to have a lesser salary poayout than the medium or large companies. Apart from that inference, any company for any position tends to have salaries at many different levels leading us to believe that the company size does not have an impact on an employees salary. 
* Can we predict salary outlooks for the future?
    - Using the dataset, we are indeed able to predict a salary outlook for the future, although, calculating how a salary would taper off would prove to be very difficult, predicting within a reasonable time from being around the next year or two would seem to be a bit more predictable. Although, in using a regression line to predict the future outlooks, one would see that the salaries would rise over time all around, no matter the job title.
